The goal of aadt_shp_to_qs is to download AADT shapefiles from [www.fhwa.dot.gov](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms/shapefiles_2017.cfm) and save clean versions by state as qs files. 

state qs files are stored at [s3://geomarker/aadt/aadt_by_state/](s3://geomarker/aadt/aadt_by_state/)
